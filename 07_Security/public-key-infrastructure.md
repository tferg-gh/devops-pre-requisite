Also referred to as PKI is the name given to the infrastructure and processes surrounding the generating, issuing and validating of public and private key pairs for asymmetric encryption, SSH and TLS. 

There are three components to PKI. The server, the client and the certificate authority (CA). 

The certificate authority issues the certificates and guarentees the certificates are legitimate.
