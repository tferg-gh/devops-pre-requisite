Why you should learn about webserver. Most new applications and most companies looking to move their applications to the cloud are doing so via webservers. 

We refer to applications installed on local systems and hosted by on-premise servers as legacy because the industry is moving away from this method of deploying applications. 

#### Standalone vs Client-Server

The calculator is a great example of a standalone application. All the code required to make it run is located located in the desktop application. It doesn't require any server communications to work. 

Slack is an example of a client-server application. The chat application is installed locally to your device called a client and needs to communicate with a server to authenticate and send/receive updates. The application is still desktop application but a client in a client-server model. 

#### Servers
A server is an application that is designed to listen for incoming requests on a network port and send information to the clients that request it. 

There are many different kinds of servers depending on it's purpose. Such as:

- Email servers 
- Chat servers
- Web servers 
- Database servers 
- Application servers 
- Backup servers

In small applications you will typically see everything being hosted by a single server/service. They may contain the web, application, database server all in one. When applications begin to get bigger you will see them split into multiple servers and they will all interact in some way.
